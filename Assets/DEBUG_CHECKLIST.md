# üîç Interaction System Debug Checklist

## Current Issues & Solutions

### ‚úÖ **Already Fixed**
1. **Input Action Configuration** - Added missing `EnterOutsideWorld` action to `BoatSailing` ActionMap
2. **Debug Logging** - Enhanced logging throughout the interaction system
3. **Old Commands Cleanup** - Marked old specific interaction commands for non-location-based use only

### üîç **Debug Steps to Follow**

**Step 1: Check Game Startup**
- [ ] Look for interaction point registration logs:
  ```
  [InteractionPointBehaviour] ‚úÖ Successfully registered Island interaction point...
  [MindOceanSystem] ‚úÖ Added interaction point...
  ```
- [ ] If missing ‚Üí InteractionPointBehaviour component not working properly

**Step 2: Check ActionMap Activation**
- [ ] When in sailing mode, press Enter and look for:
  ```
  InputManager: Action performed: InteractWithNearbyPoint in ActionMap: BoatSailing
  ```
- [ ] If missing ‚Üí Wrong ActionMap is active (should be "BoatSailing")

**Step 3: Check Position Updates**
- [ ] Move the boat and look for occasional position updates:
  ```
  [MindOceanSystem] üìç Position updated to...
  ```
- [ ] If missing ‚Üí Boat position not being updated in MindOceanSystem

**Step 4: Check Interaction Range Detection**
- [ ] Move boat close to island (within green circle) and look for:
  ```
  [MindOceanSystem] ‚û°Ô∏è Entered interaction range of...
  ```
- [ ] If missing ‚Üí Check if boat's transform.position matches island's position

**Step 5: Check State Validation**
- [ ] Press Enter near island and check state path:
  ```
  [InteractWithNearbyPointCommand] Current State: [StateName], Path: [StatePath]
  ```
- [ ] Path should contain "Sailing" for interaction to work

## üö® **Most Likely Issues**

### **Issue A: Wrong ActionMap Active**
**Symptoms:** No "InputManager: Action performed: InteractWithNearbyPoint" log
**Solution:** Check which state you're in. Make sure you're in a Sailing state that uses "BoatSailing" ActionMap

### **Issue B: Boat Position Not Updated**
**Symptoms:** No position update logs, no interaction range detection
**Solution:** Make sure ThoughtBoatSailingController.UpdatePositionInMindOcean() is being called

### **Issue C: Wrong State Path**
**Symptoms:** "Cannot interact in current state" warning
**Solution:** Ensure you're in a state with path containing "Sailing"

### **Issue D: InteractionPointBehaviour Not Registered**
**Symptoms:** No registration logs at startup
**Solution:** Check if GameManager and MindOceanSystem are properly initialized

## üîß **Quick Fixes to Try**

1. **Verify ActionMap in Inspector:**
   - Open InputManager in scene
   - Check currentActionMap field in Inspector while playing
   - Should show "BoatSailing" when in sailing mode

2. **Check Boat Position:**
   - Add this temporary debug in Update():
   ```csharp
   if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.P)) {
       Debug.Log($"Boat position: {transform.position}");
   }
   ```

3. **Force Position Update:**
   - In ThoughtBoatSailingController.Start(), add:
   ```csharp
   InvokeRepeating("UpdatePositionInMindOcean", 1f, 0.5f);
   ```

4. **Check Scene References:**
   - Make sure Island GameObject is active in hierarchy
   - Make sure InteractionPointBehaviour component is enabled
   - Check if GameManager prefab is in the scene

## üìû **Report Back**
When testing, please share:
1. Which debug logs you see/don't see
2. What happens when you press Enter near the island
3. Current state name when pressing Enter
4. Any error messages in Console
